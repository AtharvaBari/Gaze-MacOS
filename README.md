## ✨ Overview

**Gaze** is more than just a Pomodoro timer. It’s a native macOS utility that utilizes the hardware notch on modern MacBook Pros and Airs to create a "Dynamic Island" focus HUD. 

Featuring a procedural **Mascot** that tracks your cursor with its eyes, Gaze adds a layer of interactive life to your screen while keeping you on track with glass-morphic timers and smooth, system-native animations.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 📱 **Dynamic Notch Integration**: A persistent, non-intrusive HUD that hugs the camera notch.
- 👁️ **The Gaze Mascot**: A smooth, 2D procedural animation that watches your every move (cursor tracking).
- 🌊 **Liquid Animations**: Built with SwiftUI spring physics for that "Apple-smooth" expansion feel.
- 🛠️ **Sidebar Control Center**: A clean, modern settings interface with navigation-split views.
- ⚡ **Cinematic Intro**: Experience a stunning neon-grid welcome every time you launch the app.
- 🔄 **Sparkle Updates**: Secure, automatic software updates to keep your experience fresh.
